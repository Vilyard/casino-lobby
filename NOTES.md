## üö´ Problems I Ran Into

### 1. **Backdrop-filter Browser Compatibility**

**Problem**: Glassmorphism effects not working consistently across browsers
**Solution**: Added `-webkit-backdrop-filter` fallbacks and feature detection
**Learning**: Always test CSS features across different browsers and provide fallbacks

### 2. **CSS Custom Properties with Tailwind**

**Problem**: Difficulty integrating CSS variables with Tailwind's utility system
**Solution**: Created custom CSS layers and properly structured variable definitions
**Learning**: Understanding the interaction between CSS-in-JS and utility frameworks

### 3. **Performance with Complex Animations**

**Problem**: Lag on lower-end devices with multiple glassmorphism effects
**Solution**: Used CSS `contain` property and `will-change` for performance optimization
**Learning**: Visual effects must be balanced with performance considerations

### 4. **State Management Decisions**

**Problem**: Choosing between Context API, Redux, or simple useState for favorites
**Solution**: Started with Context API for maintainability and scalability
**Learning**: Choose state management based on actual complexity, not perceived future needs

## üîÆ Future Considerations

- Implement proper error boundaries for production stability
- Add comprehensive testing suite (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large game collections
- Explore advanced animations with Framer
- Add proper SEO optimization for casino game discovery
